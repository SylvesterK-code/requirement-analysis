# Requirement Analysis in Software Development
Requirement Analysis Project

Welcome to the **Requirement Analysis** repository. This repository provides comprehensive insights into the requirement analysis phase of software development.

The purpose is to help learners and developers understand the importance of clearly defining software requirements before starting development. It includes concepts, diagrams, examples, and real-world applications related to requirement gathering and analysis.

## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) where developers and stakeholders work together to understand the user's needs and define detailed requirements for the software system.

This process helps identify what the software must do (functional requirements) and how it should perform (non-functional requirements). The aim is to reduce misunderstandings and ensure the final product aligns with business goals and user expectations.

Without effective requirement analysis, the chances of project failure increase due to scope creep, missing features, or unmet expectations.

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

Requirement Analysis plays a vital role in ensuring project success. Here’s why:

- **Reduces Development Errors**: Clearly defined requirements help avoid rework and misunderstandings during development.
- **Improves Client Satisfaction**: Understanding user needs early ensures the final product meets client expectations.
- **Optimizes Resources**: With well-scoped requirements, project teams can allocate time and budget efficiently.

## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

- **Requirement Gathering**  
  Collecting information from stakeholders through interviews, surveys, and documents.

- **Requirement Elicitation**  
  Drawing out hidden needs by engaging stakeholders in discussions and brainstorming sessions.

- **Requirement Documentation**  
  Recording the gathered requirements in a structured format such as user stories, use cases, or SRS.

- **Requirement Analysis and Modeling**  
  Structuring and organizing requirements using models and diagrams to understand relationships and flows.

- **Requirement Validation**  
  Reviewing the requirements with stakeholders to ensure they are accurate, complete, and feasible.


## Types of Requirements

### Functional Requirements

Functional requirements describe **what the system should do**. They define features and functions.

**Examples for the Booking Management System:**
- Users can search for available properties by location and date.
- Users can create an account and log in.
- Admin can add, update, or delete property listings.

### Non-functional Requirements

Non-functional requirements define **how the system should perform** under certain conditions.

**Examples:**
- The system should respond to search queries within 2 seconds.
- The booking platform should be available 99.9% of the time.
- Passwords must be stored using secure encryption algorithms.


## Use Case Diagrams

Use Case Diagrams are visual representations of user interactions with a system. They help in identifying the system’s functionality from an end-user perspective and define system boundaries.

**Benefits:**
- Clarifies the roles and system functionality
- Improves communication between stakeholders
- Simplifies requirement validation

## Acceptance Criteria

Acceptance Criteria are predefined conditions that must be met for a feature or functionality to be considered complete and acceptable by the client.

They ensure that:
- Requirements are testable
- Developers and clients have the same understanding of the task
- Features are not considered done until they meet the set conditions

### Example: Checkout Feature – Booking Management System

**Feature:** Complete a property booking

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- User must be logged in to book
- Payment gateway must process the payment successfully
- Booking confirmation email must be sent to the user
- Booking details must be saved in the database
- Booking dates must be blocked from further reservations
